### Hi there 👋🏽

My name is Josh.

I'm a Brisbane based Software Engineer with a passion for Ruby and Rails.

I'm either solving problems / building cool stuff at work, or working on [open source projects](https://github.com/users/joshuay03/projects/1/views/1) in my spare time.

You can reach out to me via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuay03/), I'm always happy to chat about my work / anything tech related.

Happy coding! 👨🏽‍💻
