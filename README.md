### Hi there 👋🏽

I'm Josh.

I'm a Brisbane based Software Engineer with a passion for Ruby and Rails.

I'm either solving problems at work, using my spare time to [contribute to open source projects](https://github.com/users/joshuay03/projects/1) in any way I can, or working on my own:
- https://github.com/joshuay03/dependent-auto-rails
- https://github.com/joshuay03/red-black-tree
- https://github.com/joshuay03/puma-cfs-rails
- https://github.com/joshuay03/fiber-cfs

You can reach out to me via my socials, I'm always happy to chat about my work or anything tech related.

Happy coding! 👨🏽‍💻

Embrace it with both arms, hug it, love it and above all become passionate about it. Lukewarm is no good. Hot is no good either. White hot and passionate is the only thing to be.”
