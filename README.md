### Hi there 👋🏽

I'm Josh.

I'm a Brisbane based Software Engineer with a passion for Ruby and Rails.

I'm either solving problems at work, using my spare time to contribute to [open source projects](https://github.com/users/joshuay03/projects/1) in any way I can, or maintaining my own:
- https://github.com/joshuay03/dependent-auto-rails

You can reach out to me via my socials, I'm always happy to chat about my work or anything tech related.

Happy coding! 👨🏽‍💻
